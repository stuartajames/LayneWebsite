# Layne Hughes Real Estate — Simplified Build Plan

Last Updated: 2026-04-29
Supersedes: `dev/active/real-estate-agent-website/` (over-scoped original plan)
Review source: `dev/active/real-estate-agent-website/real-estate-agent-website-review.md`

---

## Executive Summary

A 3-week build for a Wellington NZ real estate agent's personal brand site. Harcourts-aligned styling. Three live data sources: Sanity CMS (listings, suburb stats, bio), RateMyAgent NZ (reviews), and Resend (lead email). Everything else cut.

**Stack:** Next.js 15 App Router · Tailwind CSS v4 · Sanity.io free · Resend free · Cloudflare Pages (free, commercial OK) or Vercel Pro ($20/mo)

---

## What Was Cut (and Why)

| Removed | Reason |
|---|---|
| Google Sheets CRM | Resend email to Layne *is* the CRM for 10–30 leads/month |
| Cal.com embed | Adds tracking scripts to the conversion page; Layne replies with her own calendar link |
| Leaflet / Nominatim / maps | A static suburb illustration on /about ships in 30 min and costs nothing |
| Sticky mobile CTA bar | Fights iOS Safari UI; a header CTA is sufficient |
| UptimeRobot | Theatre — alerts go to same inbox as leads |
| Health-check dashboard | Two data sources, both with fallbacks; not worth the engineering |
| Multi-source `ReviewSummaryBar` branding | RateMyAgent is the only review source; no "SourceBadge" needed |
| Hourly ISR TTL on listings | Listings are manually published — on-demand revalidation via Sanity webhook is instant and simpler |

**RateMyAgent integration is kept for day 1** but gated behind a mandatory verification step (see Phase 0).

---

## Architecture

### Stack

| Layer | Choice | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 15 App Router | Free |
| Hosting | **Cloudflare Pages** (recommended) | Free — no commercial restriction |
| — alternative | Vercel Pro | USD$20/mo — zero Next.js compatibility risk |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 | Free |
| CMS | Sanity.io free tier | Free — 10GB bandwidth, 100k API req/mo |
| Reviews | RateMyAgent `.co.nz` widget JSON | Free — no key |
| Email / leads | Resend free tier | Free — 3,000 emails/mo |
| Analytics | Cloudflare Web Analytics | Free — unlimited, no event cap |
| Domain | `laynesaywellhughes.co.nz` (placeholder) | ~$20/yr NZ |

> **Cloudflare Pages vs Vercel:** Cloudflare Pages is genuinely free for commercial sites and supports Next.js via `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`. If any Next.js feature causes compatibility issues during build, fall back to Vercel Pro — do not fight the adapter.

### Data Flow

```
Sanity CMS (listings, suburb stats, bio)
    └── lib/listings.ts  → revalidate: false + /api/revalidate webhook
    └── lib/market.ts    → revalidate: false + /api/revalidate webhook
    └── lib/bio.ts       → revalidate: false + /api/revalidate webhook

RateMyAgent .co.nz widget JSON
    └── lib/reviews.ts   → revalidate: 21600 (6hr ISR — can't webhook)
    └── Fallback: Sanity `testimonial` documents if endpoint fails

Contact form (client component)
    └── /api/contact route → Resend → Layne's inbox (structured email)
    └── No secondary storage
```

### Route Structure

```
app/
├── layout.tsx                  — root layout, header, footer
├── page.tsx                    — home (on-demand ISR)
├── listings/
│   ├── page.tsx                — listing grid (on-demand ISR)
│   └── [slug]/
│       ├── page.tsx            — property detail (on-demand ISR)
│       └── not-found.tsx       — expired slug recovery page
├── reviews/page.tsx            — review feed (6hr ISR)
├── market-insights/page.tsx    — suburb stats (on-demand ISR)
├── about/page.tsx              — bio (on-demand ISR)
├── contact/page.tsx            — contact form (client component)
├── privacy/page.tsx            — NZ Privacy Act 2020 policy (static)
└── api/
    ├── contact/route.ts        — POST: validate → Resend email
    └── revalidate/route.ts     — POST: Sanity webhook → on-demand revalidation
```

### Revalidation Strategy

| Data | Strategy | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Listings | `revalidate: false` + Sanity webhook | Developer publishes → site updates within seconds |
| Suburb stats | `revalidate: false` + Sanity webhook | Quarterly updates only |
| Bio / about | `revalidate: false` + Sanity webhook | Rarely changes |
| Reviews | `revalidate: 21600` (6hr TTL) | Can't webhook RateMyAgent; 6hr is fine |

### Components

```

├── layout/
│   ├── Header.tsx           — nav + single "Contact" CTA (no sticky bar)
│   └── Footer.tsx
├── listings/
│   ├── ListingGrid.tsx      — tabs only rendered when bucket has ≥1 listing
│   │                          defaults to "Recently Sold" if For Sale is empty
│   ├── ListingCard.tsx      — card with status pill

├── market/
│   └── MarketInsightsStrip.tsx — median price, days on market, sales volume
│                                  NO clearanceRate (not a NZ REINZ metric)
├── home/
│   └── HeroSection.tsx      — fixed "northern Wellington" headline, no suburb templating
└── shared/
    ├── ContactForm.tsx      — react-hook-form + Zod, Resend only

  salesVolume: number        // replaces clearanceRate — actually in REINZ reports
  yearOnYearChange: number   // percentage

```

## SEO

- `metadata` export on every page (title, description, OG image)
- `app/sitemap.ts` — generates from Sanity listing slugs
- `app/robots.ts`
- JSON-LD on home: `RealEstateAgent` schema
- JSON-LD on listing detail: `Product` + `Offer` schema (not `RealEstateListing` — not in Schema.org spec)
- `metadataBase`: `https://laynesaywellhughes.co.nz` (placeholder — swap when real domain confirmed)

## Environment Variables

```bash
# RateMyAgent NZ (no API key — ID only)

```

## RateMyAgent Integration — Verification Required First

**Before writing `lib/reviews.ts`**, run both of these:

```bash
# From your local machine (residential IP):
curl -i -A "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36" \
  https://www.ratemyagent.co.nz/real-estate-agent/layne-hughes-at845/reviews.json

# From a Cloudflare/Vercel edge (use a quick test function or curl from a VPS):
# Expect: 200 OK, Content-Type: application/json, reviews array
# Failure modes: 403, Cloudflare challenge, HTML response
```

**If residential works but server-side doesn't:** implement as a client-side fetch in a `useEffect` — the data loads after hydration rather than at build time. Slightly worse for SEO but the reviews section isn't indexed content anyway.

**If neither works:** remove `lib/reviews.ts` entirely; serve Sanity `testimonial` documents as the reviews section. No other code changes needed — the `Review` interface and `ReviewFeed` component remain identical.

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| RateMyAgent endpoint blocked server-side | Medium | Medium | Client-side fetch fallback; or Sanity testimonials |
| Sanity image bandwidth hits 10GB free cap | Low (initially) | Medium | Cap photos at 6 per listing, max 1280px webp via Sanity image pipeline |
| Resend email lands in spam | Medium | High | Configure SPF/DKIM/DMARC on domain before launch — needs Layne's DNS access |
| Cloudflare Pages Next.js adapter issues | Low-Medium | High | Fallback to Vercel Pro ($20/mo) — no code changes needed |
| Listings tabs show empty state | Medium | Medium | Only render tab when bucket ≥1; default to Sold |
| Privacy policy copy not provided | Medium | Medium | Explicitly Layne's responsibility — use NZ Office of the Privacy Commissioner template |

---

## Required Resources

| Resource | From | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Sanity.io account + project | Developer | Set up in Phase 0 |
| Resend account + domain verification | Developer + Layne DNS access | Phase 0 setup, DNS in Phase 2 |
| Cloudflare Pages account | Developer | Phase 0 |
| Layne's professional photos | Layne | Required before Phase 1 |
| Layne's bio copy + credentials | Layne | Required before Phase 1 |
| Privacy policy text | Layne (use OPC template) | Required before launch |
| Real domain (when confirmed) | Layne | Replace placeholder in Phase 3 |
| REINZ monthly stats PDF | reinz.co.nz (free) | Developer enters into Sanity — quarterly |

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0 — Setup (3–4 days)
Migrate Vite → Next.js 15. Configure Tailwind with Harcourts palette. Set up Sanity project + schemas. Deploy blank site to Cloudflare Pages. Verify RateMyAgent endpoint. Configure Resend domain.

### Phase 1 — Pages with mock data (4–5 days)
Build all 6 routes + components with hardcoded data. Full responsive layout. Design sign-off from Layne.

### Phase 2 — Wire up data sources (3–4 days)
Connect Sanity GROQ for listings, suburb stats, bio. Connect RateMyAgent reviews (or Sanity testimonials if blocked). Wire contact form to Resend. Set up Sanity webhook → `/api/revalidate`.

### Phase 3 — SEO, polish, launch (2–3 days)
Metadata, JSON-LD, sitemap, robots. Lighthouse audit (target ≥90/95). Privacy policy page. Enter real content into Sanity. Connect domain. Done.
